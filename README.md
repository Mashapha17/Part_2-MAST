The chef App is more like a fast food restaurant, similar to KFC and all other fast food restaurants you can think of. This app can be able to take your order and also show you the amount that you have to pay for your meal or whatever you want to eat.

So, My app has a homepage which has two bars where you can enter your meal and the price of the meal. It also has a button whereby if you want to buy more than two three items you can click it then be able to add your meals.

After adding your meals there is a button that will take you to the next page which is the checkout where it will calculate the money due then be able to pay.
